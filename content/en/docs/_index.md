Data collaboration is a common need in many research fields including finance, health care, cybersecurity, and many others. To protect data privacy in such collaborations, techniques like federated analytics, federated learning, and privacy-preserving machine learning are proposed. However, because there is no universal framework that provides a consistent data collaboration workflow, the implementation and deployment of these techniques in real-world applications are often challenging. Due to the difference in storage and computation abstractions, it is also hard to combine techniques in different works together to provide better solutions.

In this work, we plan to investigate an efficient programming abstraction to support decentralized data science. We plan to design a framework that handles storage, communication and provides multi-party data collaboration abstractions. Extending gRPC, we propose to simplify the development of multi-party protocols and allow implementations in different programming languages to work together under a consistent interface. With a unified interface that increases potential data contributors, our framework has the potential to enable larger-scale decentralized data collaboration and unlock the true value of data.
